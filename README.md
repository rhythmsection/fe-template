## What's Happening Here?

This is my personal version of create-react-app configured to the naming conventions, linting standards, layout and libraries that I prefer. This includes out-of-the-box redux and redux-router, redux-thunk, etc.

TODO:

flow typescripting
make standard work properly.
clean up packages
create slightly more intricate component. (but only slightly)
make some getters and test them
make a test repo. 

-**Install Dependencies:** `npm install`

-**Run It Locally:** `npm start`

-**Test It:** `npm test`

-**Build It:** `npm run build`
